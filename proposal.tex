\maketitle

A common and difficult problem for programmers is user interface (UI)
implementation; often the development of algorithms and datastructures is an
order of magnitude easier than programming the interface to access them! For my
computer vision project this quarter, I propose to build a tool to alleviate
part of the difficulty by automatically inferring layout constraints and some UI
elements from hand-drawn sketches. The input to the tool would be a UI sketch,
which may include:
\begin{itemize}
\item boxes indicating positions of elements,
\item text (e.g. titles or paragraphs),
\item placeholder symbols for images or complex UI widgets, and
\item width or height constraints.
\end{itemize}
The output of the tool would be an HTML document implementing the sketched UI.
Such a tool could be an enormous time-saver, especially for programmers who are
relatively unfamiliar with the various options available for laying out
webpages.
